# Login-Page

 Login Page Using React Context API

This project demonstrates how to create a simple login page using React's Context API and the `useContext` hook. It includes basic functionality for handling user login, storing credentials in context, and providing global access to user authentication status across the application.

## Features

- Simple login form with **Username** and **Password** fields.
- Uses React's Context API and the `useContext` hook to manage and provide global state for user authentication.
- Context is used to pass authentication information (user login status) to various components in the application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Context API**: A React API used for managing global state without the need for prop drilling.
- **useContext**: A hook that simplifies access to the Context API.
